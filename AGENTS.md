# OpenFrame-5F

The 5" frame. The design source is the Onshape document in
`cad/onshape.json` (OpenDrone-V2, workspace 5"); this repository holds
the link, the released exports and the parts lists. It follows the Incutec
mechanical repository template. Use the Onshape skill for any CAD work.

- Never edit a file under `releases/`. Fix the model in Onshape and release a new revision.
- A part added, removed or re-counted in the Onshape assembly changes `parts.csv` or `hardware.csv` in the same pull request.
- The 3" and 5" frames share one Part Studio in OpenDrone-V2; a change to a shared part affects both repositories.
